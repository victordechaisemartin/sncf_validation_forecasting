# ðŸš† Train Validation Prediction for SNCF-Transilien Using Deep Learning

**Context** : Challenge Data

Harnessing the power of deep learning to enhance transportation services, this project aims to accurately predict the number of train validations per day and per station for SNCF-Transilien, the main operator of suburban trains in ÃŽle-de-France. By anticipating the increase in validations, we contribute to offering more adapted services and improving the performance of our operations.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of a deep learning model capable of predicting the number of train validations per day and per station. Utilizing a dataset of validation data from SNCF-Transilien, the model is trained to recognize patterns and trends, thereby aiding in anticipating future validation numbers and enhancing transportation services.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementing techniques to clean and prepare validation data for analysis, ensuring optimal model performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Designing and training a neural network to predict the number of validations based on historical data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting validation numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backbone language for developing the deep learning model and preprocessing data.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: The primary frameworks for constructing and training the neural network model.
